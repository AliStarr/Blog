# LinkDotNet.Blog
This is a blog software completely written in C# / Blazor. The aim is to have it configurable as possible. 

## How does it work
The basic idea is that the content creator writes his posts in markdown language (like this readme file). 
The markdown will then by translated to HTML and displayed to the client. This gives an easy entry to writing posts with all the flexibility markdown has.
